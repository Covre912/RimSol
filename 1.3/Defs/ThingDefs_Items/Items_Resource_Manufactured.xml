		<description>The energy crystal - also called crystal palace - is an crystaline computer material capable of hosting artificial intelligences, from sub- to major personae, and strangely sometimes entities called archokamies, in an self-powered environment. It has the capability to programm itself for whatever purpose it has been given.\n\nEnergy crystals are an technological marvel unique to the Absol species, as they are the only ones known to produce and utilize them. Comming in various sizes and forms, the possibilities of usage are tremendous, reaching from sentient toaster computers to architectual designers of orbital space stations, at least when it is a personae. It is prooven that energy crystals can be emotional and feel physical love, but somtimes choose to disable these thoughts completely.\n\nIt is not known to humans how this technology came to be, there are only rumors of an archotech who gifted this knowledge to the Absols, which see the palaces as house for their kamies, hence the nickname.</description>
